# TODO

- Rewrite tests to verify positive results instead of just catching negative results.

## Fix false-negatives

- Actual ``null`` argument (instead of just a missing argument) should be allowed for type-hinted arguments

- Entity managers have strange definitions:

    <service id="doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager" class="Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager" factory-method="create">

  The "class" attribute will be treated the same as the "factory-class" attribute when there is a "factory-method" attribute.

- Validation of method calls should be skipped for classes that have a ``__call`` method.
